# Block Scaffolding for WordPress

Redo of [original code challenge](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17IqqQH4y4V6DBArLGMKZR-lnS8UxIE_SWI_0KQ1eBUg/edit).

Since the *Block Extend* repo doesn't exist any longer, I forked *_block-scaffolding-wp_* and used it as a template for this repo.  I believe I was able to address most of the [original concerns](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h8Z5IBrLIpMp79pufVCi9hdjJ1EvgnL9gPhF8nGpMaY/edit), but still have areas where I would benefit from some guidance.
